# Vim tutorial

The following is a short tutorial about Vim features, that assumes very little
initial familiarity with the Vim editor.

Shy of 20 years into the 21st century, many among my peers find Vim to be an
antiquated editor. It is, however, near universally available, and
surprisingly rewarding in terms of usability for many touch typists. Vim
knowledge and usage skill enable the deployment of lightweight development
environment that work equally well in pretty much any POSIX (including
emulated POSIX) platform. This bears tremendous value to old-school me, and
thus I deem it worth sharing. The learning curve for this editor is as steep
as it is said to be. However, practice makes perfect, and persistence will
reward yadda yadda yadda.

The following lesson plan suggests the introduction of features in bite-size
sets. Each should be followed with a few days of practice with the features of
the lesson, to get them into one's fingers, so to speak. Questions to the
author should be addressed by raising issues through GitHub.
